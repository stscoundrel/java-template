# Java template

Template for Java/Maven library with CI/CD & Dependabot updates.

## Status

Not updated anymore, as I haven't found myself writing traditional Java for a while. Will probably work just fine nonetheless. For similar JVM templates, see [Kotlin](https://github.com/stscoundrel/kotlin-template) and [Scala](https://github.com/stscoundrel/scala-template) templates.
